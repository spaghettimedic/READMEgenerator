  ## Description
  README Generator is a simple JavaScript program that runs with node. It is intended to allow a user to generate a markdown file, more specifically, a README.md file, to remove some of the monotony and tediousness that goes along with a project. It gives a basic outline for all the categories that a README.md file should have. The README file that you are currently reading was created with README Generator!
